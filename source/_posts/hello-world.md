excerpt: Let me introduce myself

# Who am I?
My name is Vidmantas and I am a programmer from Vilnius, Lithuania. I work as a full-stack developer on a service that automatically digitizes invoices, but I'm interested in other programming topics as well. Those include: compilers, programming language design, video game development, cli tools, desktop applications, automation. One defining characteristic of mine is that I strive to be as efficient a programmer as possible and thus I really enjoy tinkering with the settings of IDEs, making tools for myself and looking for other tools on the internet that help me be efficient. When I am not programming, I play video games and board games, I read books, fiction and non-fiction, I play guitar (and have been doing so for the last 20 years) and I have recently started skateboarding which I enjoy immensely.

# The blog
Since I'm interested in lots of different programming topics, I decided to start writing this blog and share with the world about interesting things I have learned or developed. I intend this blog to be a mix of rants, showcases of my projects and maybe some tutorials.

# Where to find me on the internet
I have an `itch.io` page where you can find the games I have released: https://vidmantas.itch.io/  
I also have a github account, where you can find all sorts of things that I have worked on in the last 4 years: https://github.com/DonutLaser  
Other than that, you can reach me at `vidmantas.gamedev@gmail.com`
